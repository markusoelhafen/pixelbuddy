# Pixelbuddy

Pixelbuddy is a Figma based pixel character builder.
With a few clicks you can create your pixelated mini-you.

### Awesome, how can I contribute?
While Figma is a collaborative tool, the file can't be just shared with anybody.
If you have a request or created an awesome component, create an [issue](https://github.com/markusoelhafen/pixelbuddy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=component-request.md&title=).
There you can link to a Figma file containing your component.
