Pixelbuddy is a Figma based pixel character builder.
With a few clicks you can create your pixelated mini-you.

This is the repo for [pixelbuddy.xyz](https://pixelbuddy.xyz), the Figma file can't be hosted on github, but is readily available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FL9vQKJFP0y5aJVQGuMUVM/Pixelbuddy/duplicate), or in Figma [community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/882926224704752261/Pixelbuddy).

## Install
This page is running on jekyll and css is preprocessed with scss.

```
git clone git@github.com:markusoelhafen/pixelbuddy.git
cd pixelbuddy
```

To compile scss a task for vscode has been setup, that automatically watches and compiles scss in the project.

Install sass:
`npm install -g node-sass`

Now you can run the task in vscode with `⇧⌘B`.

### Jekyll

Once cloned, run `bundle install` to install jekyll and its plugins.


## Looks awesome, how can I contribute?
While Figma is a collaborative tool, the file can't be just shared with anybody.
If you have a request or created an awesome component, create an [issue](https://github.com/markusoelhafen/pixelbuddy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=component-request.md&title=).
There you can link to a Figma file containing your component.
