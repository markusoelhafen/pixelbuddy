## What is Pixelbuddy?
Pixelbuddy is a pixel character builder, that utilizes Figma and it’s components to make creating pixel avatars a breeze.
Figma is a digital and collaborative design tool that runs in the browser – OS agnostic. Also there’s a free plan available.

## Does it cost anything?
No. 
Pixelbuddy is – and will be – free to use and so is Figma in its free plan. Also, Pixelbuddy is open source and released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/markusoelhafen/pixelbuddy/blob/master/LICENSE).

# Getting started
To start playing around with Pixelbuddy all you need is a browser, a (free) Figma account and a copy of the Pixelbuddy template.

## Using Figma
If you haven't used Figma before, that's no biggie. It's an easy to aquire and easy to understand digital design tool. If you used Sketch, Adobe XD or similar tools before, you should be comfortable right away. You should just have an active internet connect as Figma is a cloud based tool.

You can also [download](http://figma.com/downloads) Figma as a desktop app for macOS and Windows.

The following guides will assume you've opened the Pixelbuddy template and won't cover all Figma functionalities.

### Figma Layout

#### Top Bar
On the top left you have access to the menu, some design tools (you will only need the *Move* tool). On the top right you see sharing and scaling options. As Pixelbuddy is pixelbased it work best if you set scaling to a quite high level (~1500%).

#### Left Panel
The left hand panel shows the current layers of the project. They are not really important for using Pixelbuddy, but become more important if you want to build custom components.
On the top of this panel you can select *Assets*. This is where you can access all the components of Pixelbuddy. Heads, clothing, hair, etc.

#### Right Panel
On the right hand panel you will probably see a long list of colors at first glance. These are all the predefined colors used by Pixelbuddy.

As soon as you select a component or any other element it shows this elements properties. You can ignore most of the properties, but the *Instance* and *Selection Colors* areas.

With *Instance* you can easily switch one component with another. Learn more in the [components section]() of this guide.

The *Selection Colors* area enables you to select a color for the element you just selected. Learn more in the [colors section]() of this guide.

#### Center Panel
