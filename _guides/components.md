# Components
Figma uses the term *components* for reusable elements, that will update themselves when the *Main Component* – the original gets changed.

Pixelbuddy uses these components to provide easy access to all the elements a pixel avatar is made of – body, head, hair, clothing and accessories.

## Usage
When you first open Figma you probably see the layer list on the left hand panel. To access the components you need you click on *Assets* in the top left of the panel. 
Pixelbuddys components are sorted in folders that you need to open first. So click on *Local components* first and open the containing folders until you see small preview tiles of the components.

You can switch the display from more compact tiles preview to a list which also shows you the name of the component.

Once you found a component you want to use drag and drop it on the Artboard. The component might look a little small when you're dragging it, but will resize to it orignal file once you release it on the Artboard.

## Replacing Components
One option would be to just delete the selected component and place a new one on the artboard.

*Alternatively* you can exchange the components with each other via the component selector.
Select the element you want to exchange. 
On the right hand panel you find the section called ‘Instance’. In the dropddown below, select the option you want to use.
