# Export

You're almost ready – well done! Follow these three steps to export your Pixelbuddy so you can use it everywhere.

1. First you should select all components of your character. Click and drag to select everything.
**Attention**: Make sure the guides are out of the way.
2. Then group the layers by clicking CMD + G // CTRL + G. The outlines of the elements should be merged to only one blue outline.
3. In the right toobar on the bottom you find the area ‘Export’. Click there and select your desired file format.
For most cases PNG is just fine.

## Scaling
As the name suggests Pixelbuddy is based on pixels. But in other usecases you might want to have a bigger image of your pixel character.

## Fileformats
PNG and JPG are your standard pixel based image formats, but sometimes pixel don't cut it. If you want to get a vector based export format, you can choose SVG or PDF to export.
