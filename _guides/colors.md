# Colors
The Pixelbuddy template already comes with 50 predefined colors, so selecting a matching color for your shirt is easy peasy. But with Figma you have tthe option to select any color you can imagine.

## Changing color
Select the component you want to change colors.
In the right hand toolbar you find the section ‘Selection Colors’. Click on one color and the ‘Color Styles’ flyout open.

### Don't see all the colors?
Sometimes a component or group contains too many colors to be directly displayed in the ‘Selection Colors’ area. 
To display all, just click on ‘See all x styles’.

## Using custom color
If the predefined color options are not enough, you can of course define your own.
Click on the little *unlink* icon right next to the predefined solor in the ‘Selection Colors’ area.
Then you can work with the Figma regular color picker.
